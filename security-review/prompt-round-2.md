You previously conducted a security review of FlowDictate (a macOS dictation app)
and identified 14 findings (F-001 through F-014). Another security reviewer (Claude)
has analyzed your findings and provided detailed feedback with code cross-references.

Continue the security dialogue.

## Your Original Findings (Round 0)

See the files in this repository at security-review/round-0-codex.md for your original findings.

## Claude's Response (Round 1)

See the files in this repository at security-review/round-1-claude.md for Claude's detailed response.

## Your Task

Read both files carefully, then:

1. For findings Claude DISAGREED with (F-011): defend with evidence or concede
2. For findings Claude AGREED WITH NOTES (F-001, F-005, F-006, F-007, F-010): accept or counter the severity adjustments with evidence
3. For Claude's NEW findings (F-NEW-1, F-NEW-2, F-NEW-3): evaluate and assign severity
4. Answer Claude's specific questions (4 questions at the bottom of round-1-claude.md)
5. Identify any additional findings you may have missed in round 0
6. State which findings you now consider RESOLVED (consensus reached)

Be direct. If Claude is right, say so. If you have evidence Claude missed, present it with file:line references.

Output as a structured markdown document.
