You are conducting a comprehensive security and privacy review of a macOS
dictation application called FlowDictate.

Explore the entire codebase. Read source files, configuration, and documentation.
Identify ALL security and privacy issues.

For each finding provide:
- ID (F-001, F-002, etc.)
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info
- Title
- Description and attack scenario
- Code location (file:line)
- Recommended fix

Focus areas: credential management, audio data handling, permissions, network
security, input validation, memory safety, logging/info disclosure, dependency
security, sandboxing, privilege escalation, clipboard security, side channels.

Be adversarial. Assume you're preparing for a security certification.

Output your findings as a structured markdown document with a summary table at the top
followed by detailed sections for each finding.
